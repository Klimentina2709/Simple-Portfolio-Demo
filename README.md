# Multi-Page Web Application

## Project Overview

This is a multi-page personal portfolio website built as part of my web development journey. The project showcases my work and skills through various sections, including a **carousel** for project displays, a **filtering system** for easy navigation, and an **About Me** section. This was my first attempt at building a portfolio, and it allowed me to work with **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **Materialize CSS** to create a responsive, functional, and visually appealing site.

The project served as an essential starting point in my coding career, providing hands-on experience in structuring web applications, developing interactive elements, and improving user experience.
